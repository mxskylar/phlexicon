# Phlexicon

Beginner-friendly phonetic keyboards for spoken & sign languages on desktop Mac, Windows, & Linux.

Type [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) using the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet)
for spoken languages and [SignWriting](https://www.signwriting.org/about/) for sign languages.
Choose from a list of phonemes used by a particular dialect or optionally, all phonemes in the IPA or SignWriting.

The application is still under development and is only available for developers to [build from scratch](https://github.com/mxskylar/phlexicon).
This user guide will be updated when Phlexicon is available for installation.

Phlexicon would be nothing without the open source data and frameworks it depends on.
