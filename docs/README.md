# Phlexicon

A phonetic catalog for lexicons:
- **Study a language:** Build a personal database of the signs, gestures, and words in the languages you study.
- **Document vocabulary:** Define and translate vocab in custom dictionaries. 
- **Analyze accents:** Break down vocab into its fundamental partsâ€”[phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme), the individual sounds of a word or parameters of a gesture or sign.

Phlexicon would be nothing without the open source data and frameworks it depends on.
