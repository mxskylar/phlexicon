# Phlexicon

A catalog of [phonemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme) in hundreds of languages, dialects, and lexiconsâ€”both [signed](https://www.signwriting.org/about/) and [spoken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet).

## Install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/mxskylar/phlexicon/releases/latest) for your operating system:

- **macOS:** If your Mac uses an M1 chip, download an `arm64` file. Either download a `zip` or `dmg` file.
- **Windows:** Download the `exe` installer.
- **Linux:** Download an `rpm`, `deb`, `AppImage`, `pacman` file.

## Development

Phlexicon is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app built with [Node](https://nodejs.org/) `v23.10.0`.

Use the following commands to build and debug the application. See the [package.json](package.json) to understand how they are configured.

### Commands

Builds then launches the app from scratch.

```bash
npm start
```

*Deletes cache?* **Yes**, web resources & raw data previously downloaded by `postinstall` script are deleted then re-installed. If it exists, the previous version of the application bundled by `npm run app` are deleted then re-created.

---

Installs Node packages listed in the `package.json`, web resources (JavaScript UI frameworks, CSS style themes, & fonts), and raw data that will be inserted into the database by the `npm run app` command.

```bash
npm install
```

*Deletes cache?* **Yes**, web resources & raw data previously previously downloaded by the command are deleted, then re-installed. This does *not* apply to Node packages listed in the `package.json`, which are only re-installed if they do not exist in the cache.

---

Only installs Node packages listed in the `package.json`. Skips the `postinstall` script that installs all other dependencies.

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

*Deletes cache?* **No**, only installs Node packages that are not already in the cache. Preserves all other dependency caches that may contain web resources, raw data, etc.

---

Rebuilds `sqlite3` module for Electron build.

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
```

*Deletes cache?* Only rebuilds `sqlite3` package used by Electron build.

---

Bundles then launches the app.

```bash
npm run app
```

*Deletes cache?* **Yes**, deletes the bundle for the previous version of the app, if it exists, then re-creates it.

---

Bundles the application by copying web resources (JavaScript UI frameworks, CSS style themes, & fonts)
into the bundle directory, parsing and inserting raw data into the database, compiling TypeScript into JavaScript,
and bundling React with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).


```bash
npm run init-app
```

*Deletes cache?* **Yes**, deletes the bundle for the previous version of the app, if it exists, then re-creates it.

---

Compiles [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) into JavaScript.

```bash
npm run compile-typescript
```

*Deletes cache?* **Partially**, replaces JavaScript files in application bundle, if they exist, with newly compiled files.

---

Bundles [React](https://react.dev/) JavaScript framework with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
npm run compile-react
```

*Deletes cache?* **Partially**, replaces JavaScript files in application bundle, if they exist, with newly compiled files.

---

Creates the database from scratch, inserts data, transpiles Typescript into JavaScript, then bundles the application with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

```bash
npm run build
```

*Deletes cache?* **Yes**, deletes the bundle for the previous version of the app, if it exists, then re-creates it.

---

Launches the Electron application.

```bash
npm run electron
```

*Deletes cache?* **No**, launches the app using its existing bundle.

---

Packages app distribution for macOS. Only works when run on macOS.

```bash
npm run dist-mac
```

*Deletes cache?* **Partially**, replaces files for previous app macOS distribution, if they exist.

---

Packages app distribution for Windows.

```bash
./electron-builder-docker win
npm run dist-win
```

These commands may give the following, expected error while still succeeding to package the app for Windows.

```
0024:err:environ:run_wineboot failed to start wineboot 1
```

*Deletes cache?* **Partially**, replaces files for previous app Windows distributions, if they exist.

---

Packages app distribution for Linux.

```bash
./electron-builder-docker linux
npm run dist-linux
```

*Deletes cache?* **Partially**, replaces files for previous app Linux distributions, if they exist.
